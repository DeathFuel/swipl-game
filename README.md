# swipl-game
A small top-down action adventure game written in SWI-Prolog. Requires version 9.x.x and support for Unicode characters.
Note: some terminal emulators may display the characters improperly. In my testing, Konsole worked best, while Alacritty misplaced or cut off certain wide characters - though YMMV. 

Made for educational purposes; published as part of a gentlemanly agreement.
## Running
Run with SWI-Prolog 9.x.x and load the game with the `l/0` predicate:
```bash
$ swipl game.prolog
```
```prolog
?- l.
```
